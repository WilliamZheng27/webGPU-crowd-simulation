# webGPU-crowd-simulation Milestone Report

## Work We've Done



## Goals Review



## Poster Session Plan

We plan to show a graph of simulation result exported from the implementation. We are still working towards the possiblility of presenting a live demo and we are happy to do so if things go well.

## Issues

- WebGPU is quite new so it's not supported by all browsers and platforms.
- Debugging programs on it could be quite tricky.
- There's limited resources out there for this new standard.
