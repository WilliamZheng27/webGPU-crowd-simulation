# webGPU-crowd-simulation Milestone Report

## Work We've Done
We have studied the basics of WebGPU and built a simple 2D Boids simulation following a tutorial as both a practice and a starting point for implementing the crowd simulation algorithm. We have also thoroughly read the crowd simulation algorithm paper in the proposal.

## Goals Review
We were able to finish the first two milestones on time (proposal & webGPU Demo), but behind schedule for the latest milestone (implementing the algorithm with WebGPU) due to our thanksgiving travel plan. We still believe we will be able to complete all deliverables, and the updated schedule and goals are listed below.
| Date | Goals |
| --- | ----- |
| 12/9 | Implement the algorithm using WebGPU API |
| 12/12 | Optimize the algorithm for real-time framerate |
| 12/14 | Final Report |


## Poster Session Plan

We plan to show a graph of simulation result exported from the implementation. We are still working towards the possiblility of presenting a live demo and we are happy to do so if things go well.

## Issues

- WebGPU is quite new so it's not supported by all browsers and platforms.
- Debugging programs on it could be quite tricky.
- There's limited resources out there for this new standard.
